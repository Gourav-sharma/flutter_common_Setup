- Dashboard page
- List page
- Bloc architecture
- API calls
- Get Storage

- Device permissions

## How to use this project?
1. Clone the project
2. Open the project in Android Studio or VS Code
3. Run the project on a simulator or a physical device
4. Use the app to see how Bloc Architecture is implemented

## What is Bloc Architecture?
Bloc Architecture is a state management architecture that helps in building scalable and maintainable applications. It helps in separating the business logic of the application from the UI. It is based on the following components:

- Bloc: A container that holds the state of the app and notifies the UI of any changes in the state.
- Event: An event is something that happens in the app, such as a button click. It is used to trigger a UI update.
- State: The state of the app is the data that is stored in the Bloc. It is used to render the UI.

## How to use Bloc Architecture in a Flutter application?
1. Create a Bloc for each feature of the app
2. Define the events and states for each Bloc
3. Use the Bloc to update the UI
4. Use the Bloc to handle events and update the state

## What are the benefits of using Bloc Architecture?
1. Scalability: Bloc Architecture makes it easy to add new features to the app without having to rewrite the existing code.
2. Maintainability: Bloc Architecture makes it easy to maintain the app because it separates the business logic from the UI.
3. Reusability: Bloc Architecture makes it easy to reuse the code in different parts of the app.
